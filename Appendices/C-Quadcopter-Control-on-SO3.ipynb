    "Box-minus explained: tilde-states are defined here as actual-state minus reference-state. Rotation matrices can't be added or subtracted together which means you can't say $\\tilde{R}=R-R_r$.

    "### Derivation of Error-State Dynamics\n",
    "This section will derive the equations for error-state dynamics, needed for MPC control. There are 2 different ways that approximations are made throughout these derivations: 1) the substitution for $R_r$ using a 1st order approximation of a matrix exponential - shown above 2) whenever there are 2 tilde variables multiplied together, they are assumed to be 0 because they should be quite small. Another thing to note is that and the end of the position error-state and velocity error-state derivations, a trick was used to isolate $\\tilde{\\bs{\\phi}}$ by playing with the fact that the hat operator is the same as a cross-product operator. This works for SO(3), but might not work for other manifolds."

    "### Jacobian Linearization\n",
    "In order to find the A and B matrices, we will use Jacobian linearization on the equations for error state dynamics. We will partially linearize about equilibrium as will be explained. We will assume that the equilibrium for the attitude of the quadcopter is its current attitude: $R_e = R$. We will not linearize about the reference command $R_r$. This assumption is made due to previous experimentation. I found that the results are the best when $R_e = R$. My thought is that, since I am not really following a trajectory but am using step commands, $R_e$ and $R_r$ both have the z-axis pointing down in an NED coordinate frame. This means that the model used for MPC always thinks the sum of all 4 motor forces acts perfectly upward even though when the vehicle turns, the force vector also rotates. This makes gravity seem stronger due to a loss of force applied in the upward direction and there is a negative coupling effect on the vehicle's height (it will drop or do funny things when the vehicle is tilted). To compensate for this, $R$ is used as $R_e$ since gravity will be properly rotated. All of the other equilibrium values will remain at true equilibrium: $\\bs{\\tau}_e=\\b{v}_e=\\bs{\\omega}_e=\\b{p}_e=[0,0,0]^T, \\ \\ f_e = mg$."

    "MPC, which is similar to LQR, was explained in [Unit 1 - Chapter 5: Optimal Control](../Unit-1-SO2/1.5-Optimal-Control.ipynb#Linear-Model-Predictive-Control). As a refresher, MPC uses a convex optimization solver (CVXGEN) with a model (state-space) to predict a defined number of time-steps into the future by varying the input, u. The first step is taken (apply the first set of calculated inputs) and then the process is repeated, predicting the same number of steps into the future starting from the new updated states. The optimization solver minimizes a cost function subject to the provided constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time horizon and the discretization time could be chosen in a different way, but I used a time horizon of 10 steps with the size of the step (discretization time) being the settling time of the system divided by the time horizon. This means my MPC controller will take 10 equally spaced steps to predict 4 seconds into the future. Theoretically, better performance would come by increasing the time horizon and decreasing the discretization time; however, this becomes much more computationally expensive. Through some experimentation, I found that a time horizon greater than 10 usually doesn't make much of a difference. This could be due to the fact that MPC only takes the 1st of the predicted steps and then recalculates everything all over again."

    "Since I had an existing framework built with Simulink, I decided to keep the code in MATLAB rather than redo everything in Python for this notebook. A repo containing the simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/mhask94/Quadcopter_MPC). This repo contains 2 directories: Lie_Group and Euler_Angles. Both directories have a simulation of a quadcopter. The difference is that the plant and controller both model attitude with either Euler angles or the SO(3) Lie Group. Further instruction on how to use the code can be found in the README from the link above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A diagram of the Simulink framework is shown below. There are 4 signal generators creating square waves as the reference commands for N, E, H, and psi. The reference commands along with the current states are passed into the controller. The controller uses the vectorized error-state for attitude (see [implementation](https://github.com/mhask94/Quadcopter_MPC/blob/master/Lie_Group/control.m#L7)). The controller outputs the 4 throttle commands, 1 for each motor. The control effort is plotted with the upper and lower bounds and is also the input to the dynamics block. The output of the dynamics block is all of the states. Note that there are 18 outputs when there are only 12 states needed to define the system. This is because the dynamics is using all 9 parameters in the rotation matrix rather than the 3 that are needed. This is so that the SO(3) Lie Group kinematics could be modeled: $\\dot{R}=R[\\bs{\\omega}]^\\wedge$. The rotation matrix is reshaped into a column vector with 9 elements so that it can be outputted from the s-function modeling the plant (see [implementation](https://github.com/mhask94/Quadcopter_MPC/blob/master/Lie_Group/dynamics.m#L154)). This rotation matrix along with all the other states are fed back into the controller. The current states for position and attitude (N,E,H,R) are also passed into the Draw Quadcopter block which creates the animation as well as plots all of the reference commands with the current respective states."
